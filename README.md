# Image-Organizer
It's a Program that organize your photos by year/month/day

This program will create an icon in the Context Menu that will allow you to organize the photos in your folder by Year and than, Year/Month/Day.

This idea cames from a brazilian Youtube channel called "CÃ³digo Fonte TV" (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFuIUoyHB12qpYa8Jpxoxow) in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8KFB0VyEwo&t=5s and I started with this video and I was gradually improving.

I wanna say Thank you to "Codigo Fonte TV" for getting me excited to start programming in python.
